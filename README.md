# Predictive Analysis of CO₂ Capture in MOFs Using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the CO₂ adsorption capacity of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on their textural, chemical, and process properties. The work aims to enhance the understanding of factors influencing MOF performance and guide the development of high-efficiency materials for sustainable carbon capture.

## **Introduction**
Carbon capture is critical to mitigating climate change, and MOFs are promising materials due to their tunable porosity and high surface area. This project focuses on predicting CO₂ adsorption capacity using machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.

## **Motivation**
The scattered nature of adsorption-related data poses a challenge for material design. By compiling a comprehensive dataset and applying machine learning, this project aims to:
- Identify key factors influencing CO₂ adsorption.
- Provide actionable insights for researchers to develop better MOFs.
- Streamline the discovery of high-performance materials.
